Algorithms Level 1 - Efficient Solutions

üìñ Overview

This repository contains solutions to 50 algorithmic problems covered in Algorithms Level 1 with Dr. Mohammed Abo-Hadhoud. The solutions focus on writing efficient code using:

Procedures & Functions for modularity

Structures & Enums for data organization

Optimized Problem-Solving Techniques

Dr. Mohammed emphasized connecting the dots between different algorithmic concepts through these 50 questions.

üèÜ Key Topics Covered

Procedures & Functions: Used to break down complex problems into reusable and modular components.

Structures & Enums: Implemented for better data representation and organization.

Efficiency Optimization: Applied techniques to improve execution time and memory usage.

Problem-Solving Approach: Solutions are structured to demonstrate step-by-step thinking and clarity.
